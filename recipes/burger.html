<br>
Prep time: 10 minutes <br>

Cook time: 10 minutes <br>

Servings: 2-3 patties</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 can (15 oz) of black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>1/4 cup breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped red onion</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul> 


    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>In a medium bowl, mash the black beans with a fork until they are mostly broken down but still have some texture. <br>

Add the breadcrumbs, red onion, cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well. The mixture should be firm enough to form into a patty. If it's too wet, add a little more breadcrumbs. <br>

Form the mixture into two to three patties. <br>

Cook the patties in a lightly oiled pan over medium heat for 4-5 minutes per side, or until golden brown and heated through. Serve on buns with your favorite toppings.</p>
