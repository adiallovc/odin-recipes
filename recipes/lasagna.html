Cook Time: 2 hours <br>
Servings: 8-10 <br>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

For the Meat Sauce: <br>
* 1 tbsp olive oil <br>
* 1 lb ground beef2 <br>
* 1/2 lb ground Italian sausage <br>
* 1 large onion, finely chopped<br>
* 3 cloves garlic, minced<br>
* 1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes3<br>
* 1 (15 oz) can tomato sauce<br>
* 2 tbsp tomato paste<br>
* 1 tsp dried oregano4<br>
* 1 tsp dried basil<br>
* 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (optional, for a kick)<br>
* Salt and black pepper to taste<br><br>
For the Cheese Filling:<br>
* 15 oz whole-milk ricotta cheese<br>
* 1 large egg<br>
* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese5<br>
* 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped<br>
* Salt and black pepper to taste<br><br>
For Assembly:<br>
* 12-15 lasagna noodles, cooked al dente<br>
* 2 cu\ps shredded mozzarella cheese<br>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

1. Prepare the Meat Sauce: In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and Italian sausage, breaking up the meat with a spoon. Cook until browned. Drain any excess grease. Add the onion and garlic, and cook until the onion is soft and translucent. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, oregano, basil, and red pepper flakes. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cook for at least 1 hour, or up to 2 hours, stirring occasionally. The longer it simmers, the richer the flavor.<br>
2. Make the Cheese Filling: In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, Parmesan cheese, and fresh parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Mix until well combined.<br>
3. Assemble the Lasagna: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.<br>
    * Layer 1: Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of the dish to prevent noodles from sticking.<br>
    * Layer 2: Arrange a single layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce.<br>
    * Layer 3: Spread half of the ricotta cheese filling evenly over the noodles.<br>
    * Layer 4: Top with a generous layer of meat sauce.<br>
    * Layer 5: Sprinkle with about one-third of the mozzarella cheese.<br>
    * Repeat the layers once more: noodles, remaining ricotta filling, meat sauce, and another third of the mozzarella.<br>
    * For the final layer, place the remaining noodles on top, cover with the rest of the meat sauce, and finish with the remaining mozzarella cheese.<br>
4. Bake: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.<br>
5. Rest and Serve: Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. This allows the layers to set, making it easier to slice. Serve hot.</p>
