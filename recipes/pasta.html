    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A hearty and convenient one-pot meal that combines rich marinara sauce with savory Italian sausage and your favorite pasta. It's a perfect dinner solution for a busy evening.
<br>
<br>
Prep time: 5 minutes <br>
Cook time: 20-25 minutes <br>
Servings: 4-6</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1 pound Italian sausage</li>
    <li>1 box of rigatoni (or your favorite pasta)</li>
    <li>1 jar of marinara sauce</li>
    <li>Water</li>
</ul>


<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
Cook the Italian sausage in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until browned and cooked through. Use a spoon to break it up as it cooks. Drain any excess fat. <br>

Add the entire jar of marinara sauce to the pot with the sausage. <br>

Add the dry pasta directly into the sauce and stir to combine. <br>

Add enough water to the pot to just cover the pasta. <br>

Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Stir occasionally to prevent the pasta from sticking to the bottom. Continue to simmer until the pasta is cooked and the sauce has thickened. This will take about as long as the pasta box recommends, and the pasta will absorb the liquid, creating a rich and flavorful sauce.</p>
